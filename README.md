#Swift 3 New Features
This is the code repository for [Swift 3 New Features](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/swift-3-new-features?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786469632), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.




The code will look like the following:
```
h5> oneMillion = "one million"
error: repl.swift:11:12: error: cannot assign to value: 'oneMillion' is a
'let' constant
oneMillion = "one million"
~~~~~~~~~~~^
repl.swift:2:1: note: change 'let' to 'var' to make it mutable`
let oneMillion = 1\_000\_000`
^~~~
var
```

To develop in Swift 3 on a Mac, you will need Xcode 8 and macOS Sierra 10.12.  If you would like to take advantage of Swift on Linux, you need access to a Linux machine or virtual machine capable of running Ubuntu 14.04.
